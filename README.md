## Building

```bash
# Standard build
go build -o phantom.exe .

# Production build (smaller, no debug symbols)
go build -ldflags "-s -w -H windowsgui" -o phantom.exe .

# With garble for obfuscation (install: go install mvdan.cc/garble@latest)
garble -literals build -ldflags "-s -w -H windowsgui" -o phantom.exe .
```

**Requirements:**
- Go 1.21+
- Windows (uses Windows-specific APIs)
- CGO enabled (for SQLite)

## Detection & Defense

### How to Detect This Type of Malware:
1. Monitor registry Run keys for suspicious entries
2. Watch for SQLite database access in browser directories
3. Detect DPAPI calls from non-browser processes
4. Monitor webhook/API traffic to Discord/Telegram
5. Use behavior-based AV that detects credential access patterns

### How to Protect Yourself:
1. Use a password manager (browser-stored passwords are vulnerable)
2. Enable 2FA on all accounts
3. Don't store sensitive files on Desktop/Documents
4. Use hardware wallets for cryptocurrency
5. Keep systems updated with EDR/AV solutions
6. Be suspicious of random executables

## Notes

too lazy to manually add commits, last minute github post lol

this started as a learning project to understand windows internals and how stealers actually work. figured id throw it up here in case anyone else finds it useful for defensive research or just wants to poke around the code.

if you're a security researcher, hope this helps with your work. if you're trying to use this for actual malicious purposes, seriously reconsider your life choices.

PRs welcome for educational improvements, bug fixes, or adding more detection methods to the defense section.
